## About
  Since i never created slider by myself I made the wrong decision in the slider structure. For finger-following swipes i can use hiden side-scroll and scroll with fingerposition.
  For multiple slides on the screen we can add 2 more slides (1 on left side, and 1 on right side) + set smaller width for all of them. Later I will modify it so it will fit all criteria
